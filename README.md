The **nano7** language is a simple, embeddable,  procedural language (and it's interpreter). The language has only global variables and integer arithmetic. Nano7 uses built-in variables. 
Their scope is global. Variables are identified by the English ABC letters ("A","B","C" .."Z").

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

"**A**" is an array expandable up to 32k, the elements of which can contain 4-byte signed integers. By default, only the first element (A.0) exists.

Syntax:   
**A.0 = 16** or 
  
**A.9 = 16** or  
  
B = 9  
**A.B = 16** or 

B = 9  
C = 2  
**A.B = C * 8**

"**B**".."**Q**" are used to store 4-byte signed integer values.

"**R**" Writing **R** sets the maximum value of the random number generator and reading **R** results in a random number that falls between 0 and the set maximum value (-1). 
By default, this maximum value is 100, and the largest number that can be generated is 99.

"**S**".."**Z**" stores a single 1-byte integer value. when printing, the PRN instruction evaluates the stored value as an ASCII code.

**Arithmetic and logical operators:**  

 (add) 
 (sub) 
 (mul) 
 (div) 
 (mod) - 
 (less) 
 (more) 
 (equal)

**Var assignment:**  

The operator of assignment is "**=**".  
Syntax:

B = number (integer)  
B = 12

B = variable  
B = C

B = variable arithmetic_op number  
B = C + 12  

B = variable arithmetic_op variable  
B = C - D  

B = INP (INPUT must be 4 bytes signed integer only)  

**Keywords:** IF, JMP (jump), RET(urn), PRN (print), NOP, INP(ut), TRC (trace)


**IF**   
The IF must be followed by a logical condition, which, if true, will execute the code following the condition (the end of the line). If the condition is not true, the execution moves to the next line.

Syntax:  **IF B > A.0 PRN B**

No THEN and no ELSE! 
Only the IF keyword, the CONDITION and the instruction ( PRN or JMP or ASSIGN).

IF B > A.0 PRN B

**JMP**  
Jump instruction that must be followed by a tag that the interpreter detected and registered when reading the script. The return address (line) stored in the variable named 'stack'. Lol

Syntax: **JMP .LABEL_ONE**  

**RET**  
This is the additional (RETurn) statement for labels. If this is included in one of the lines after the label, then after the RET line, the code execution returns to the line+1 where it was before jumping to the label. Thus, lines written between a LABEL and a RET instruction become a subroutine.  

Syntax:

.SUB_LABEL  
B = B * 2  
IF B = C PRN S  
IF B > C PRN T  
RET  

**PRN**  
Print statement, which must be followed by at least one variable identifier. The PRN instruction cannot directly print numbers or characters, only values ​​of variables. It interprets the values ​​of the **S..Z** variables as ASCII code and prints the character corresponding to the code. For example:

T = 65   
PRN T

Output: A

**NOP**  
No code execution occurs. The purpose of the instruction is to separate two labels below one another so that they do not end up at the same address.

**INP**  
Reads a signed integer value from the keyboard.  
The syntax:

B = INP or   
A.4 = INP or   
A.B = INP  

------------------------------------------------------------------
The comment must begin with ; char 

Warning! 
In the nano7 scripts, must be one (or more) space between two language elements. 
In the nano7 scripts only the single expressions allowed: one math (and/or) one logic operator in one code line. 
The nano7 script language does not use parentheses or brackets. 
The legal chars: A..Z, 0..9, SPACE, DOT, < = > + - * / % _
and nothing more.  

Don't forget! 
The nano7 made for educational purposes.

**The classical structure of a nano7 script:**  

TRC
JMP .BEGIN

.SUB_INC   
 IF B < C B = B + 1   
 PRN B S   
 RET  

.BEGIN   
 B = 1  
 C = 5   
 S = 32  
 T = 10  
   
.LOOP   
 JMP .SUB_INC   
 IF B = C JMP .END  
 JMP .LOOP
  
.END  
  
**Here is the output (with TRC):**
